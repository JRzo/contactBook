## Technology Stack (Example - You'll need to choose your own)

This is a potential technology stack you might use to build this application:

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Frontend Framework/Library (Optional but Recommended):** React, Vue.js, or Angular
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js, Python with Flask or Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.
* **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.

## Setup and Installation (General Steps)

These are general steps. The specific instructions will depend on the technologies you choose.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Example for Node.js with npm
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    # Example for Python with pip
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up the database:**
    * Create a database instance.
    * Configure the database connection details in your backend application (e.g., environment variables).
    * Run any necessary database migrations or schema creation scripts.

4.  **Install frontend dependencies (if using a framework/library):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    # Example for React with npm
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    # Example for Vue.js with npm
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Configure frontend API URL:**
    * Set the URL of your backend API in your frontend application.

6.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    # Example for Node.js
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    # Example for Python Flask
    python app.py
    ```

7.  **Run the frontend development server (if using a framework/library):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    # Example for React
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    # Example for Vue.js
    npm run serve
    ```

8.  **Open your browser:** Navigate to the frontend URL (usually `http://localhost:3000` or similar).

## Usage

1.  **Registration:** New users can click on a "Sign Up" or "Register" link to create a new account by providing a username and password.
2.  **Login:** Existing users can log in using their registered username and password.
3.  **Adding Contacts:** Once logged in, navigate to the "Add Contact" section. Enter the contact's name and either their phone number or email address. Click "Save" or "Add".
4.  **Viewing Contacts:** Go to the "Contacts" or "My Contacts" page to see a list of all the contacts you have saved.
5.  **Deleting Contacts:** On the "Contacts" page, there should be an option (e.g., a "Delete" button) next to each contact to remove it from your list.

## Further Development (Optional Enhancements)

* **Edit Contacts:** Allow users to modify the details of existing contacts.
* **Contact Groups:** Enable users to organize their contacts into groups.
* **Search/Filtering:** Implement a way to search or filter through the contact list.
* **Data Validation:** Add more robust validation for input fields (e.g., email format).
* **Improved UI/UX:** Enhance the user interface and overall user experience.
